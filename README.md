Dog Dating Website Prototype

Technology used:
Bootstrap 5.1 
HTML
CSS3

Optimizations: Refactoring CSS

Although the Website was made using a tutorial, but here is the catch about my learning. The tutorial included Bootstrap 4.0 whereas Bootstrap 5.1 is on the run right now. 
Therefore I did my reserach on multiple places on how to add the same features using the Bootstrap 5.1 into my code base. apart from this CSS used was also outdated and 
I did my reserach to incorporate new keywords of the same task which the tutorial was playing around.
